This project is a simple, responsive landing page for Tech Vayuna, a student-led tech community. It features a modern design with a sticky navigation bar, an engaging hero section with animations, an "About" section describing the club’s vision, and a call-to-action encouraging users to join. The page is fully responsive and mobile-friendly, with smooth hover effects, a gradient header, and a clean footer. It serves as an introductory website to showcase the community’s mission and attract new members.
